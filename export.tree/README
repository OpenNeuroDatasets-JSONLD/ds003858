The goal of this experiment was to test the effects of simultaneous multi-slice imaging (or multi-band acquisition) on detectability of fMRI signal in the mesolimbic reward circuitry. In this dataset, participants performed three runs of the Monetary Incentive Delay Task within the same session each acquired with either single-slice, multi-band factor of 4, or multi-band factor of 8. The order of the runs were counterbalanced across participants.
